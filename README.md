# Soft-Robotics-Modeling
In this project, we perform system identification of a soft robotics finger. We will firstly model the finger using the standard model, then using an hyper elastic model. Finally we will compare the Ecoflex and Dragonskin 30 fingers.
A video of us recording data can be found on Youtube.
Please note that initial data cleaning is done in python in readcsv.ipynb while the remaining system identification is performed in Matlab.
